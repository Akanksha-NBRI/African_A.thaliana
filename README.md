This repository contains scripts for the paper Durvasula and Fulgione et al 201X. "African genomes shed light on the early history of Arabidopsis thaliana".

The analyses are based on a VCF file that contains genotype calls through the SHORE pipeline for all 1001 genomes individuals and the new individuals included with this paper.

## pop_structure
This folder contains analyses and plotting scripts for figure 1 of the paper, which elucidates population structure.

## diversity
This folder contains analyses scripts for figure 2, which describes the diversity present in African thaliana populations.

## msmc
This folder contains analyses scripts for figure 3, which uses MSMC v2 for population history reconstruction.
